### Background / About

CSS animations are an incredible way to give sites a very polished and professional look. Unfortunately many people don't realize just how easy they are to implement. I created CSS Ani-mate to help guide those looking to learn how to use CSS Animations. The app not only provides instructions and guides for how to use keyframes and animations, but also a playground to adjust prebuilt animations and easily copy the code for personal projects.
